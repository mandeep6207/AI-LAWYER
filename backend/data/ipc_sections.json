Z, believing the ground to be firm, treads on it,\nfalls in and is killed. A has committed the offence of culpable\nhomicide.\n(b) A knows Z to be behind a bush. B does not know it.

Z dies in\nconsequence. A commits murder.\n(b) A, knowing that Z is labouring under such a disease that a\nblow is likely to cause his death, strikes him with the intention of\ncausing bodily injury. Z dies in consequence of the blow. A is guilty\nof murder, although the blow might not have been sufficient in the\nordinary course of nature to cause the death of a person in a sound\nstate of health. But if A, not knowing that Z is labouring under any\ndisease, gives him such a blow as would not in the ordinary course of\nnature kill a person in a sound state of health, here A, although he\nmay intend to cause bodily injury, is not guilty of murder, if he did\nnot intend to cause death, or such bodily injury as in the ordinary\ncourse of nature would cause death.\n(c) A intentionally gives Z a sword-cut or club-wound sufficient\nto cause the death of a man in the ordinary course of nature. Z dies\nin consequence. Here A is guilty of murder, although he may not have\nintended to cause Z's death.\n(d) A without any excuse fires a loaded cannon into a crowd of\npersons and kills one of them. A is guilty of murder, although he may\nnot have had a premeditated design to kill any particular individual.\nException 1.-When culpable homicide is not murder.-Culpable\nhomicide is not murder if the offender, whilst deprived of the power\nof self-control by grave and sudden provocation, causes the death of\nthe person who gave the provocation or causes the death of any other\nperson by mistake or accident.\nThe above exception is subject to the following provisos:-\nFirst.-That the provocation is not sought or voluntarily provoked\nby the offender as an excuse for killing or doing harm to any person.\nSecondly.-That the provocation is not given by anything done in\nobedience to the law, or by a public servant in the lawful exercise of\nthe powers of such public servant.\nThirdly.-That the provocation is not given by anything done in\nthe lawful exercise of the right of private defence.\nExplanation.-Whether the provocation was grave and sudden enough\nto prevent the offence from amounting to murder is a question of fact.\n168\nIllustrations\n(a) A, under the influence of passion excited by a provocation\ngiven by Z, intentionally kills Y, Z's child. This is murder, inasmuch\nas the provocation was not given by the child, and the death of the\nchild was not caused by accident or misfortune in doing an act caused\nby the provocation.\n(b) Y gives grave and sudden provocation to A. A, on this\nprovocation, fires a pistol at Y, neither intending nor knowing\nhimself to be likely to kill Z, who is near him, but out of sight. A\nkills Z. Here A has not committed murder, but merely culpable\nhomicide.\n(c) A is lawfully arrested by Z, a bailiff. A is excited to\nsudden and violent passion by the arrest, and kills Z. This is murder,\ninasmuch as the provocation was given by a thing done by a public\nservant in the exercise of his powers.\n(d) A appears as a witness before Z, a Magistrate. Z says that he\ndoes not believe a word of A's deposition, and that A has perjured\nhimself. A is moved to sudden passion by these words, and kills Z.\nThis is murder.\n(e) A attempts to pull Z's nose. Z, in the exercise of the right\nof private defence, lays hold of A to prevent him from doing so. A is\nmoved to sudden and violent passion in consequence, and kills Z. This\nis murder, inasmuch as the provocation was giving by a thing done in\nthe exercise of the right of private defence.\n(f) Z strikes B. B is by this provocation excited to violent rage.\nA, a bystander, intending to take advantage of B's rage, and to cause\nhim to kill Z, puts a knife into B's hand for that purpose. B kills Z\nwith the knife. Here B may have committed only culpable homicide, but\nA is guilty of murder.\nException 2.-Culpable homicide is not murder if the offender in\nthe exercise in good faith of the right of private defence or person\nor property, exceeds the power given to him by law and causes the\ndeath of the person against whom he is exercising such right of\ndefence without premeditation, and without any intention of doing more\nharm than is necessary for the purpose of such defence.\nIllustration\nZ attempts to horsewhip A, not in such a manner as to cause\ngrievous hurt to A. A draws out a pistol. Z persists in the assault. A\nbelieving in good faith that he can by no other means prevent himself\nfrom being horsewhipped, shoots Z dead. A has not committed murder,\nbut only culpable homicide.\nException 3.-Culpable homicide is not murder if the offender,\nbeing a public servant or aiding a public servant acting for the\nadvancement of public justice, exceeds the powers given to him by law,\nand causes death by doing an act which he, in good faith, believes to\nbe lawful and necessary for the due discharge of his duty as such\npublic servant and without ill-will towards the person whose death is\ncaused.\nException 4.-Culpable homicide is not murder if it is committed\nwithout premeditation in a sudden fight in the heat of passion upon a\nsudden quarrel and without the offender's having taken undue advantage\nor acted in a cruel or unusual manner.\nExplanation.-It is immaterial in such cases which party offers\nthe provocation or commits the first assault.\nException 5.-Culpable homicide is not murder when the person\nwhose death is caused, being above the age of eighteen years, suffers\ndeath or takes the risk of death with his own consent.\n169\nIllustration\nA, by instigation, voluntarily causes Z, a person under eighteen\nyears of age, to commit suicide. Here, on account of Z's youth, he was\nincapable of giving consent to his own death; A has therefore abetted\nmurder."

It could not\ntherefore be taken out of Z's possession, and A has not committed\ntheft, though he may have committed criminal breach of trust.\n(f) A finds a ring belonging to Z on a table in the house which Z\noccupies. Here the ring is in Z's possession, and if A dishonestly\nremoves it, A commits theft.\n(g) A finds a ring lying on the high-road, not in the possession\nof any person. A, by taking it, commits no theft, though he may commit\ncriminal misappropriation of property.\n(h) A sees a ring belonging to Z lying on a table in Z's house.\nNot venturing to misappropriate the ring immediately for fear of\nsearch and detection, A hides the ring in a place where it is highly\nimprobable that it will ever be found by Z, with the intention of\ntaking the ring from the hiding place and selling it when the loss is\nforgotten. Here A, at the time of first moving the ring, commits\ntheft.\n(i) A delivers his watch to Z, a jeweller, to be regulated. Z\ncarries it to his shop. A, not owing to the jeweller any debt for\nwhich the jeweller might lawfully detain the watch as a security,\nenters the shop openly, takes his watch by force out of Z's hand, and\ncarries it away. Here A, though he may have committed criminal\ntrespass and assault, has not committed theft, inasmuch as what he did\nwas not done dishonestly.\n188\n(j) If A owes money to Z for repairing the watch, and if Z\nretains the watch lawfully as a security for the debt, and A takes the\nwatch out of Z's possession, with the intention of depriving Z of the\nproperty as a security for his debt, he commits theft, inasmuch as he\ntakes it dishonestly.\n(k) Again, if A, having pawned his watch to Z, takes it out of\nZ's possession without Z's consent, not having paid what he borrowed\non the watch, he commits theft, though the watch is his own property\ninasmuch as he takes it dishonestly.\n(l) A takes an article belonging to Z out of Z's possession\nwithout Z's consent, with the intention of keeping it until he obtains\nmoney from Z as a reward for its restoration. Here A takes\ndishonestly; A has therefor committed theft.\n(m) A, being on friendly terms with Z, goes into Z's library in\nZ's absence, and takes away a book without Z's express consent for the\npurpose merely of reading it, and with the intention of returning it.\nHere, it is probable that A may have conceived that he had Z's implied\nconsent to use Z's book. If this was A's impression, A has not\ncommitted theft.\n(n) A asks charity from Z's wife. She gives A money, food and\nclothes, which A knows to belong to Z her husband. Here it is probable\nthat A may conceive that Z's wife is authorized to give away alms. If\nthis was A's impression, A has not committed theft.\n(o) A is the paramour of Z's wife. She gives a valuable property,\nwhich A knows to belong to her husband Z, and to be such property as\nshe has not authority from Z to give. If A takes the property\ndishonestly, he commits theft.\n(p) A, in good faith, believing property belonging to Z to be A's\nown property, takes that property out of B's possession. Here, as A\ndoes not take dishonestly, he does not commit theft."

A, in order to defraud B, adds cipher to the 10,000, and makes the\nsum 1,00,000 intending that it may be believed by B that Z so wrote\nthe letter. A has committed forgery.\n(b) A without Z's authority, affixes Z's seal to a document\npurporting to be a conveyance of an estate from Z to A, with the\nintention of selling the estate to B and thereby of obtaining from B\nthe purchase-money. A has committed forgery.\n(c) A picks up a cheque on a banker signed by B, payable to\nbearer, but without any sum having been inserted in the cheque. A\nfraudulently fills up the cheque by inserting the sum of ten thousand\nrupees. A commits forgery.\n(d) A leaves with B, his agent, a cheque on a banker, signed by\nA, without inserting the sum payable and authorizes B to fill up the\ncheque by inserting a sum not exceeding ten thousand rupees for the\npurpose of making certain payments. B fraudulently fills up the cheque\nby inserting the sum of twenty thousand rupees. B commits forgery.\n(e) A draws a bill of exchange on himself in the name of B\nwithout B's authority, intending to discount it as a genuine bill with\na banker and intending to take up the bill on its maturity. Here, as A\ndraws the bill with intent to deceive the banker by leading him to\nsuppose that he had the security of B, and thereby to discount the\nbill, A is guilty of forgery.\n(f) Z's will contains these words-\"I direct that all my remaining\nproperty be equally divided between A, B and C.\" A dishonestly\nscratches out B's name, intending that it may be believed that the\nwhole was left to himself and C. A has committed forgery.\n(g) A endorses a Government promissory note and makes it payable\nto Z< for his order by writing on the bill the words \"Pay to Z or his\norder\" and signing the endorsement. B dishonestly erases the words\n\"Pay to Z or his order\", and thereby converts the special endorsement\ninto a blank endorsement. B commits forgery.\n(h) A sells and conveys an estate to Z. A afterwards, in order to\ndefraud Z of his estate, executes a conveyance of the same estate to\nB, dated six months earlier than the date of the conveyance to Z,\nintending it to be believed that he had conveyed the estate to B\nbefore he conveyed it to Z. A has committed forgery.\n(i) Z dictates his will to A. A intentionally writes down a\ndifferent legatee named by Z, and by representing to Z that he has\nprepared the will according to his instructions, induces Z to sign the\nwill. A has committed forgery.\n(j) A writes a letter and signs it with B's name without B's\nauthority, certifying that A is a man of good character and in\ndistressed circumstances from unforeseen misfortune, intending by\nmeans of such letter to obtain alms from Z and other persons. Here, as\nA made a false document in order to induce Z to part with property, A\nhas committed forgery.\n(k) A without B's authority writes a letter and signs it in B's\nname certifying to A's character, intending thereby to obtain\nemployment under Z. A has committed forgery inasmuch as he intended to\ndeceive Z by the forged certificate, and thereby to induce Z to enter\ninto an express or implied contract for service.\n205\nExplanation I.-A man's signature of his own name may amount to\nforgery.\nIllustrations\n(a) A signs his own name to a bill of exchange, intending that it\nmay be believed that the bill was drawn by another person of the same\nname. A has committed forgery.\n(b) A writes the word \"accepted\" on a piece of paper and signs it\nwith Z's name, in order that B may afterwards write on the paper a\nbill of exchange drawn by B upon Z, and negotiate the bills as though\nit had been accepted by Z. A is guilty of forgery; and if B, knowing\nthe fact, draws the bill upon the paper pursuant to A's intention, B\nis also guilty of forgery.\n(c) A picks up a bill of exchange payable to the order of a\ndifferent person of the same name. A endorses the bill in his own\nname, intending to cause it to be believed that it was endorsed by the\nperson to whose order it was payable; here A has committed forgery.\n(d) A purchases an estate sold under execution of a decree\nagainst B. B, after the seizure of the estate, in collusion with Z,\nexecutes a lease of the estate to Z at a nominal rent and for a long\nperiod and dates the lease six months prior to the seizure, with\nintent to defraud A, and to cause it to be believed that the lease was\ngranted before the seizure. B, though he executes the lease in his own\nname, commits forgery by antedating it.\n(e) A, a trader, in anticipation of insolvency, lodges effects\nwith B for A's benefit, and with intent to defraud his creditors; and\nin order to give a colour to the transaction, writes a promissory note\nbinding himself to pay to B a sum for value received, and antedates\nthe note, intending that it may be believed to have been made before A\nwas on the point of insolvency. A has committed forgery under the\nfirst head of the definition.\nExplanation 2.-The making of a false document in the name of a\nfictious person, intending it to be believed that the document was\nmade by real person, or in the name of a deceased person, intending it\nto be believed that the document was made by the person in his\nlifetime, may amount to forgery.\nIllustration\nA draws a bill of exchange upon a fictious person, and\nfraudulently accepts the bill in the name of such fictitious person\nwith intent to negotiate it.
